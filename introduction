python is a scripting language but also support object oriented programming.

Class : it describe data and provide methods to manipulate that data,all encompassed under a single object.
        A class i blueprint from which object are created.

Major principles of object-oriented programming system are :
1.object
2.class
3.methods
4.inheritance
5.data abstraction
6.encapsulation
7.polymorphism

Method : The method is a function that is associated with an object. a method is not unique to class instances.
         Any object type can have methods.

Super : It is used to give access to methods and properties of a parent orsibling class.
        The super() function returns an object that represents the parent class.

operator overloading : python operator works for built-in classes. but some operators behaves differentlywith different
                       types.This features allows same operator to have different meaning according to the context is
                       class operator overloading.

Operator Magic Methods :
+  __add__(self,other)
-  __sub__(self,other)
*  __mul__(self,other)
/  __truediv__(self,other)
// __floordiv__(self,other)
%  __mod__(self,other)
**  __pow__(self,other)

Comperison  Operator
<   __lt__(self,other)
>   __gt__(self,other)
<=  __le__(self,other)
>=  __ge__(self,other)
==  __eq__(self,other)
!=  __ne__(self,other)

Assignment Operator
-=  __isub__(self,other)
+=  __iadd__(self,other)
*=  __imul__(self,other)
/=  __idiv__(self,other)
//=  __ifloordiv__(self,other)
%=  __imod__(self,other)

Meta Class : a metaclass defines the behavior of classes and their instances.It is a class whose instances are classes.
             type is a most common meta type.

Stack : it is based on last in first out(LIFO).
